;; Concept:
;;
;; Gets and refreshes the db-view from the server. Provides the server
;; API endpoint '/db-view/get' with the `:db-view/input` map from the
;; app state. Receives the `:db-view/output` map in the API response
;; and stores it in the app state. Reagent will trigger a rerender of
;; all UI components which depend on changed parts of the
;; `:db-view/output`.
