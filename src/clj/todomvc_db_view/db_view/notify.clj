;; Concept:
;;
;; Provides an API endpoint that allows clients to listen for changes
;; in the Datomic transaction log, which affect their current
;; logged-in user.
;;
;; Thereby the client can refresh the `:db-view/output` map as soon as
;; it is notified by this API endpoint. HTTP long polling is used here
;; to allow the server to push a message to the client. It is less
;; complex to implement in comparison to WebSockets. Furthermore the
;; low latency and reduced payload size of WebSockets is not required
;; for this use case.

(defonce client-listeners-state
  ;; holds the httpkit channels of the clients, which are waiting for
  ;; a db-view notify:
  (atom {}))
